# [Empathy Prompts](http://empathyprompts.net/)

Inclusive Design principles to consider when making things for others to use.

These prompts are intended to help build empathy, not describe any one person's experience. These prompts are <em>not</em> intended to tokenize the experience of the individuals experiencing these conditions.

## About this page

You're on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a service that helps people build digital things. Projects are called "repositories", or "repos" for short. Repositories are collections of files managed by [Git](https://git-scm.com/), software that helps people code and collaborate.

One file in this repo is called a Readme, which helps helps describe what the project is, why it was made, and how you can help out with it. GitHub takes the Readme for every repo and displays it on the project's homepage for easier discovery.

### Language and terminology concerns

I'm striving to be as respectful as possible. If you feel the words or tone for one of the prompts isn't using the proper terminology, or isn't representative of the condition, please let me know, either [publicly](https://github.com/ericwbailey/empathy-prompts/labels/%5BType%5D%20Terminology) or [privately](https://github.com/ericwbailey/empathy-prompts/blob/master/AUTHORS).

### Issues and Pull Requests
